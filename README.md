An anonymous function is a method without a name, defined using the delegate keyword.
It can be assigned directly to a delegate type.

A lambda expression is a shorter, cleaner syntax for writing anonymous methods.
It uses the => operator (called the “goes to” operator).

Feature	Anonymous Function	Lambda Expression
Syntax	delegate (parameters) { ... }	(parameters) => expression or { ... }
Verbosity	Longer, requires delegate keyword	Shorter, cleaner
Readability	Okay for small use cases, but can be bulky	Preferred in modern C#

In modern C#, lambda expressions are more widely used because they’re cleaner and integrate seamlessly with LINQ, events, and delegates.
